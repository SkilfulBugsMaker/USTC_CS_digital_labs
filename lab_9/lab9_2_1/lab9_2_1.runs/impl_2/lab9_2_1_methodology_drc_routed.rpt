2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U2/s_reg[7]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U2/s_reg[0]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[1]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[2]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[3]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[4]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[5]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[6]_P/PRE, U2/s_reg[7]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell U2/s_reg[7]_LDC_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) U2/s_reg[0]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[1]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[2]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[3]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[4]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[5]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[6]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[7]_C/CLR, U2/s_reg[7]_LDC/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>
